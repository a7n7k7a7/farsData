This helps in simple exploration of the data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). This is an assignment work for the "Building R Packages" course on Coursera, as part of the Johns Hopkins University "Mastering Software Development in R" specialization.

## Data source
The data in this package come from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

In order to load the data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fname <- make_filename(2013)
data_2013 <- fars_read(fname)
head(data_2013)
```

In order to read multiple datasets
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
data.list <- fars_read_years(c(2013, 2014, 2015))
```
The code returns a list of tibbles.

## Summarising
The package enables quick summary of the data. In order to do so you can use fars_summarize_years() function. It takes a year (or vector of years) as an argument and returns a tibble summarising number of cases per month and year.
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
fars_summarize_years(2013:2015)
```

## Plotting map
Finally, farsData package enables plotting map of cases in one state using maps package. To do so, you can use fars_map_state() function. It takes a year and a state number as arguments.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fars_map_state(36, 2014)
```
